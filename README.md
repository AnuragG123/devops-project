To delete a database in AWS Glue using a Boto3 script, you can use the `boto3` library in Python. Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize Glue client
glue_client = boto3.client('glue')

# Specify the name of the database you want to delete
database_name = 'your_database_name'

try:
    # Delete the specified database
    response = glue_client.delete_database(
        Name=database_name
    )
    print(f"Database '{database_name}' deleted successfully.")
except glue_client.exceptions.EntityNotFoundException:
    print(f"Database '{database_name}' not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

Replace `'your_database_name'` with the name of the database you want to delete. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to delete databases in AWS Glue. This script will catch exceptions if the database does not exist or if there are any other errors during the deletion process.
