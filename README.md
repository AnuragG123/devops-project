If the folder names are in the format "YR_MNTH" (e.g., "2024_03" for March 2024), you can modify the code to extract the creation date from the folder names and then compare it with the cutoff date. Here's the modified code:

```python
import boto3
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract bucket name and prefix from the event
    bucket_name = event['bucket']
    prefix = event['prefix']

    deleted_folders = delete_old_folders(bucket_name, prefix)
    
    if deleted_folders:
        send_email_notification(deleted_folders)

def delete_old_folders(bucket_name, prefix):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    deleted_folders = []

    # Calculate cutoff date
    cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=8*365)

    # List objects in the bucket with the given prefix
    response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name, Prefix=prefix)

    # Iterate through objects and delete those older than cutoff date
    if 'Contents' in response:
        for obj in response['Contents']:
            key = obj['Key']
            creation_date_str = key.split('/')[1]  # Assuming the folder name is part of the key after the prefix
            creation_date = datetime.strptime(creation_date_str, '%Y_%m')
            
            if creation_date < cutoff_date:
                print(f"Deleting folder: {key}")
                s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key)
                deleted_folders.append(key)
    
    return deleted_folders

def send_email_notification(deleted_folders):
    SENDER = "your_ses_verified_email@example.com"
    RECIPIENTS = ["anurag@gmail.com", "gouthami@gmail.com"]
    SUBJECT = "Folder Deletion Notification"
    CHARSET = "UTF-8"

    # Create email body
    email_body = f"The following folders have been deleted:\n\n"
    for folder in deleted_folders:
        email_body += f"- {folder}\n"

    # Create the email message
    email_message = {
        'Subject': {'Data': SUBJECT, 'Charset': CHARSET},
        'Body': {'Text': {'Data': email_body, 'Charset': CHARSET}}
    }

    # Create a new SES client
    ses_client = boto3.client('ses')

    # Try to send the email
    try:
        # Provide the contents of the email
        response = ses_client.send_email(
            Destination={'ToAddresses': RECIPIENTS},
            Message=email_message,
            Source=SENDER
        )
    # Display an error if something goes wrong
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {e.response['Error']['Message']}")
    else:
        print("Email sent successfully")
```

In this modified code, it extracts the creation date from the folder name part of the object key after the prefix. It then converts this creation date into a datetime object for comparison with the cutoff date.
